# Design Doc: IELTS Writing Scoring Criterial Agent

> Please DON'T remove notes for AI

## Requirements
I. General System Requirements & Core Knowledge (Applicable to both Tasks)
Understanding of IELTS Band Descriptors:
The agent must have an internal representation or model of the official IELTS Writing Band Descriptors (for Bands 0-9) for all four criteria.
It must be able to differentiate the nuanced language used to describe performance at each band level for each criterion.
Input Processing:
Ability to accept text input (e.g., typed, pasted, potentially uploaded .txt or .docx).
Basic text cleaning (e.g., handling strange characters, multiple spaces) without altering original meaning or errors relevant to scoring (like spelling).
Output Requirements:
Provide an overall band score (e.g., 6.0, 6.5, 7.0).
Provide individual band scores for each of the four criteria.
Provide specific, actionable feedback linked to the band descriptors, explaining why a certain score was given for each criterion.
Highlight areas of strength and weakness.
(Optional but highly valuable) Suggest specific ways to improve.
(Optional) Identify and categorize grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation errors.
Word Count Calculation:
Accurately calculate the word count according to IELTS rules (e.g., hyphenated words, numbers).
Know the penalty implications for being under the word limit (150 for Task 1, 250 for Task 2).
Plagiarism/Memorization Detection (Advanced):
(Optional, advanced) Capability to detect if parts of the response are likely memorized phrases or plagiarized content, which can negatively impact scores.
Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Capabilities:
Semantic Understanding: Grasp the meaning of sentences and paragraphs.
Syntactic Analysis: Parse sentence structures.
Discourse Analysis: Understand how ideas are connected across the text.
Lexical Analysis: Analyze vocabulary usage.

### Brand 0 
**All Criteria**
Should only be used where a candidate did not attend or attempt the question in any way, used a language other than English throughout, or where there is proof that a candidateâ€™s answer has been totally memorised.

IV. Data Requirements for AI Training (Crucial for the AI to "Learn")
A very large, diverse dataset of IELTS Task 1 and Task 2 scripts.
These scripts must be accurately scored by certified IELTS examiners (ideally multiple examiners per script for inter-rater reliability).
Scores should be available for overall band and for each of the four criteria.
(Ideal) Scripts should be annotated with specific errors, strengths, and feedback corresponding to the band descriptors. This is key for the AI to learn why a script gets a certain score.
Data should cover a wide range of band scores, topics, and writer proficiency levels.
V. Important Considerations for the AI Agent:
Holistic Scoring vs. Rule-Based: While the AI needs to "know" the rules, IELTS scoring is ultimately holistic. The AI should aim to mimic this, not just count errors.
Avoiding Bias: The training data must be diverse to prevent the AI from being biased against certain writing styles or backgrounds (as long as they fall within acceptable academic English).

## Implementation Approach

### Flow Design
The IELTS Writing Scoring CREtical Agent follows a simple sequential flow pattern:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    submission[Get Submission] --> scoring[Score Essay]
    scoring --> display[Display Results]
```

### Node Implementation

1. **GetIELTSSubmissionNode**:
   - Collects task type (1 or 2), writing prompt, and essay from the user
   - Calculates word count
   - Stores submission in a structured format

2. **IELTSScoreNode**:
   - Selects appropriate prompt template based on task type
   - Formats prompt with submission details
   - Calls LLM to evaluate the essay
   - Parses JSON response into structured score data

3. **DisplayScoreNode**:
   - Formats score data into a readable report
   - Displays overall band score, criteria scores, strengths, areas for improvement, and suggestions

### Utility Functions

1. **count_words**:
   - Accurately counts words in the essay
   - Handles special characters and extra spaces

2. **extract_json_from_llm_response**:
   - Extracts and parses JSON from LLM response
   - Handles potential formatting issues

### Data Models

1. **IELTSTask1Criteria** and **IELTSTask2Criteria**:
   - Store scores for each criterion (0-9 scale)
   - Calculate overall band score

2. **IELTSFeedback**:
   - Store strengths, areas for improvement, and suggestions

3. **IELTSTask1Score** and **IELTSTask2Score**:
   - Combine criteria scores and feedback
   - Include overall band score

4. **IELTSWritingSubmission**:
   - Store task type, prompt, essay, and word count
Continuous Learning: The AI should ideally be updatable as IELTS guidelines evolve or as more training data becomes available.
Explainability: The agent's reasoning for a score should be as transparent as possible to the user.

> Notes for AI: Keep it simple and clear.
> If the requirements are abstract, write concrete user stories


## Flow Design

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Consider the design patterns of agent, map-reduce, rag, and workflow. Apply them if they fit.
> 2. Present a concise, high-level description of the workflow.

### Applicable Design Pattern:

1. Map the file summary into chunks, then reduce these chunks into a final summary.
2. Agentic file finder
   - *Context*: The entire summary of the file
   - *Action*: Find the file

### Flow high-level Design:

1. **First Node**: This node is for ...
2. **Second Node**: This node is for ...
3. **Third Node**: This node is for ...

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    firstNode[First Node] --> secondNode[Second Node]
    secondNode --> thirdNode[Third Node]
```
## Utility Functions

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Understand the utility function definition thoroughly by reviewing the doc.
> 2. Include only the necessary utility functions, based on nodes in the flow.

1. **Call LLM** (`utils/call_llm.py`)
   - *Input*: prompt (str)
   - *Output*: response (str)
   - Generally used by most nodes for LLM tasks

2. **Embedding** (`utils/get_embedding.py`)
   - *Input*: str
   - *Output*: a vector of 3072 floats
   - Used by the second node to embed text

## Node Design

### Shared Store

> Notes for AI: Try to minimize data redundancy

The shared store structure is organized as follows:

```python
shared = {
    "key": "value"
}
```

### Node Steps

> Notes for AI: Carefully decide whether to use Batch/Async Node/Flow.

1. First Node
  - *Purpose*: Provide a short explanation of the nodeâ€™s function
  - *Type*: Decide between Regular, Batch, or Async
  - *Steps*:
    - *prep*: Read "key" from the shared store
    - *exec*: Call the utility function
    - *post*: Write "key" to the shared store

2. Second Node
  ...
